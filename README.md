# my_activities

How to get started:
1. Open strava_data.php and set your Strava access token ($ACCESS_TOKEN). More information on how to get the token here: https://strava.github.io/api/
2. Open main.js and change the MONTHLY_GOAL, RUNNING_GOAL_M and RUNNING_GOAL_TIME_S variables to your goal.

The monthly goal represents the total amount of activities completed per month (running + cycling).
Note: It is only possible to set a distance/time goal for running activities.
